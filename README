postfix_mailq - Simple nagios plugin for checking Postfix mail queue

Author: Johan Hedberg, City Network Hosting AB <jh@citynetwork.se>

It checks the different queues separately and doesn't care much for hold
like the standard check_mailq plugin would do. It also requires that a
single queue gets over the limit and not all of them together.

Accepted command line options are solely -c and -w for setting the warning
and critical queue levels. Upon reaching warning or critical state on one
queue, the queue in question becomes uppercase in output so the sysadmin
quickly can see which queue he or she has to look at.
